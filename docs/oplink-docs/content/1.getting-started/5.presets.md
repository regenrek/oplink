OPLINK comes with several ready-to-use presets to help you get started quickly. These presets are organized by category and provide powerful functionality out of the box.

## Using Presets

To enable presets, use the `--preset` flag when starting the MCP server:

```bash
npx oplink@latest server --preset thinking,coding,github
```

Or in your Cursor configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflows-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["oplink@latest", "server", "--preset", "thinking,coding,github"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Presets

### Thinking Presets

Tools designed to improve reasoning on any task.

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **generate_thought** | Reflect on a thought and produce a reflection/new set of thoughts. Takes a required `thought` parameter. |
| **deep_thinking_mode** | Comprehensive multi-perspective analysis with detailed reflections on ideas, problems, or questions. |

### Coding Presets

Universally applicable tools for common coding tasks.

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **debugger_mode** | Systematic multi-step debugging with hypothesis creation, telemetry gathering, and testing. |
| **architecture_mode** | System design prompt with tradeoff analysis and implementation planning. |
| **planner_mode** | Systematic code change planning with codebase analysis. |
| **prd_mode** | Structured product requirements documentation for features, user stories, and spike analysis. |
| **save_note** | Document ongoing work with comprehensive progress tracking. |

### GitHub Presets

Tools to simplify common GitHub tasks.

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **pr_review_mode** | Comprehensive pull request analysis with security considerations. |
| **pr_creation_mode** | Structured PR creation process using GitHub CLI. |
| **create_branch** | Smart branch creation with contextual naming. |
| **save_changes** | Systematic git commit and push workflow. |

## Preset Examples

### Thinking Mode Example

The thinking mode preset helps you reflect on ideas:

```yaml
generate_thought:
  description: "Reflect on a thought and produce a reflection/new set of thoughts"
  parameters:
    thought:
      type: "string"
      description: "A thought to deeply reflect upon"
      required: true
  prompt: |
    Deeply reflect upon the provided thought step-by-step.
    Reflect upon the implications/tradeoffs it may have as it relates to my current goals, challenges and our conversation.
    Do not change anything in our system, just return some thoughts/considerations/analysis based on your reflection of the provided thought.

    Here is the thought to reflect on:
    {{ thought }}
```

### Debugger Mode Example

The debugger mode preset provides a structured approach to solving problems:

```yaml
debugger_mode:
  description: "Systematically debug issues with a structured problem-solving approach"
  prompt: |
    You are now entering "Debugger Mode" - a structured problem-solving approach to debug issues.

    1. Understand the problem
       - What's the expected behavior?
       - What's the actual behavior?
       - When did the issue start occurring?
       
    2. Gather information
       - Examine error messages and logs
       - Search for and review related code
       - Check console and network logs
       
    3. Isolate the issue
       - Identify the component or module where the problem occurs
       - Determine if it's a frontend, backend, database or integration issue
       - Review recent changes that might have caused the problem

    4. Test hypotheses
       - Propose 5-7 possible causes
       - Identify 1-2 most likely causes
       - Implement targeted logs to verify each hypothesis
       
    5. Fix and verify
       - Suggest fixes based on analysis
       - Implement approved fixes systematically
       - Check for side effects and regressions
```

## Presets vs. Workflows

- Workflows are the actual YAML tools your IDE calls. They live under `.mcp-workflows` in your repo and are fully editable.
- Presets are curated bundles of workflows shipped with Oplink. You can:
  - Run them ephemerally with `--preset` (no files required), or
  - Copy them into your repo with `npx oplink@latest add <preset>` to customize.

Available built‑in presets: `thinking`, `coding`, `github`, `examples`, `template-tools`.

Use `--preset` to try things quickly; use `init` + `add` when you want versioned, team‑shared workflows in your project.

<!-- Custom presets removed to avoid confusion with the dedicated Workflows section. -->
