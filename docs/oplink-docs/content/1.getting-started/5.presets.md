Use these examples as starting points. Copy the YAML blocks into your `.mcp-workflows/workflows.yaml` (or separate `.yml` files) and adjust as needed.

## Examples

### Thinking Mode Example

```yaml
generate_thought:
  description: "Reflect on a thought and produce a reflection/new set of thoughts"
  parameters:
    thought:
      type: "string"
      description: "A thought to deeply reflect upon"
      required: true
  prompt: |
    Deeply reflect upon the provided thought step-by-step.
    Reflect upon the implications/tradeoffs it may have as it relates to my current goals, challenges and our conversation.
    Do not change anything in our system, just return some thoughts/considerations/analysis based on your reflection of the provided thought.

    Here is the thought to reflect on:
    {{ thought }}
```

### Debugger Mode Example

```yaml
debugger_mode:
  description: "Systematically debug issues with a structured problem-solving approach"
  prompt: |
    You are now entering "Debugger Mode" - a structured problem-solving approach to debug issues.

    1. Understand the problem
       - What's the expected behavior?
       - What's the actual behavior?
       - When did the issue start occurring?
       
    2. Gather information
       - Examine error messages and logs
       - Search for and review related code
       - Check console and network logs
       
    3. Isolate the issue
       - Identify the component or module where the problem occurs
       - Determine if it's a frontend, backend, database or integration issue
       - Review recent changes that might have caused the problem

    4. Test hypotheses
       - Propose 5-7 possible causes
       - Identify 1-2 most likely causes
       - Implement targeted logs to verify each hypothesis
       
    5. Fix and verify
       - Suggest fixes based on analysis
       - Implement approved fixes systematically
       - Check for side effects and regressions
```

## Tips

- Keep examples small and focused; compose multiple workflows rather than one giant tool.
- Store workflows in your repo under `.mcp-workflows/` so they’re versioned with the code.
